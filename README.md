# Rim-of-Madness---Vampires
Adds Vampires to RimWorld.

This is a rehost of the rehost (by ZeroKato) of the original repository (by Jecrell), fixed "Vampires Change Each Reload" only for 1.2, but you can try to replace Vampire.dll in 1.1 folder. Maybe it will work.
you can find rehost by ZeroKato here: https://github.com/ZeroKato/rof-vampires
